# NAME

Mason::Plugin::WithEncoding - add encoding support to Poet/Mason apps

# VERSION

Version 0.01

# SYNOPSIS

    In your Poet config file:
    
        mason:
          extra_plugins:
            - WithEncoding
            
        server.encoding.request: UTF-8
        server.encoding.response: UTF-8
        server.default_content_type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

# DESCRIPTION

To decode the request, the plugin loads [Plack::Request::WithEncoding](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Request::WithEncoding) and 
configures it with the encoding specified in `server.encoding.request`. If no 
such setting is found, the request is not decoded. This matches the default 
behaviour of Poet/Mason, but is different from [Plack::Request::WithEncoding](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Request::WithEncoding), 
(which would normally default to UTF-8).

Output generated by your Mason templates is encoded according to the setting 
in `server.encoding.response`. If no such setting is found, the response is not 
encoded. This is the default behaviour of Poet/Mason. 

The content-type default header is set according to `server.default_content_type`. 
If no such setting is found, the default header is `text/html`, as in the default 
Poet/Mason setup. This tells the client what encoding to use when decoding our 
content, and also (AFAIK) tells the client what encoding to use when sending us 
data. 

Output sent through `send_json` is also encoded and the content-type header 
set accordingly.

## Caveat

If you are using Mason outside of a [Poet](https://metacpan.org/pod/Poet) environment, the plugin will only 
encode the output. In a [Poet](https://metacpan.org/pod/Poet) environment, it also decodes the request.

## TODO 

Check the FillInForm filter, maybe convert to use [HTML::FillInForm::ForceUTF8](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTML::FillInForm::ForceUTF8).
